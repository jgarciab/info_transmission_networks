"Throughout history people did not die of cancer and heart disease. They tended to die from accidents and from the bacterial infections which followed these accidents. This trend began to change after the development of penicillin. The new antibiotic drug eliminated most deaths from bacterial infections. However, bacteria are living things and evolve and change over time. Eventually generations of bacteria became resistant to our antibiotics. So scientists developed stronger drugs and bacteria developed stronger resistances. Over and over again this happened until now pharmaceutical companies have lost interest in developing a newer, stronger, antibiotic which will only become obsolete. Currently approximately 50,000 die of bacterial infection every year but the world is on track to exceed 10 million deaths per year from bacterial infections by the year 2050.

The most likely reason for this is simply because they didn't live long enough to develop them, being gored by an ox, injured on the battlefield, crushed during the industrial revolution, or most commonly dying from infection after sustaining these injuries.

In the modern age, due to the creation of antibiotics, we no longer have to fear death from a simple infection, but this so-called golden age of medicine may be coming to a close.

"Before the invention of antibiotics, people died much younger than they do today. They would die because they sustained injuries that were then infected.

Penicillin was discovered in 1928. This, and other antibiotics, saved many lives. It meant that infections that once killed could now be cured. Many antibiotics were developed after penicillin. However, antibiotics are becoming less useful than they once were.

This is because bacteria can evolve in order to survive contact with antibiotics. For decades, scientists would develop an antibiotic, bacteria would begin to become resistant, and scientists would develop more antibiotics. But now, bacteria have become so resistant to antibiotics that pharmaceutical companies often feel it is not worth it to develop new antibiotics.

Fortunately, there are things people can do to slow antibiotic resistance. They can forego using them for minor infections. They can also avoid eating food that is routinely treated with antibiotics.",0,23,148,0,3,"[""Through history, most people didn't die of cancer or heart disease, the lifestyle diseases that are common in the Western world today.

"Penicillin, discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928, was truly a miracle drug for the world. Infections were dispensed with in a matter of days now, and people no longer died routinely from various infections if they could access penicillin. The drug saved lives of American soldiers during WW11, probably saving 15% of the men who normally would have perished.

The problem now, however, stems from a massive over-use of antibiotics in the modern world. The bacteria antibiotics fight have become extremely resistant to them, so that more and more ""super bugs"" are appearing, which are not fazed in the least by any antibiotics leveled against them. In fact, it has become such a difficult/impossible task to try to treat these bugs that drug companies have given up on trying to deal with them.

We're kinda on our own unless the rampant overuse of antibiotics can be meaningfully curbed both in animals, shrimp, and humans.

It saved the lives of thousands of allied forces during WWII. And millions since then. But the antibiotics are not working as well as they used to.

We have been living inside the golden epoch of the miracle drugs, and now, we are coming to an end of it.\n\nPeople are dying of infections again because of a phenomenon called antibiotic resistance, or popularly referred to as “superbugs”. Bacteria compete against each other for resources, for food, by manufacturing lethal compounds that they direct against each other. When we first made antibiotics, we took those compounds into the lab and made our own versions of them, and bacteria responded to our attack the way they always had.\n\nFor 70 years, we played a game of leapfrog -- our drug and their resistance, and then another drug, and then resistance again -- and now the game is ending. Bacteria develop resistance so quickly that pharmaceutical companies have decided making antibiotics is not in their best interest, so there are infections moving across the world for which, out of the more than 100 antibiotics available on the market, two drugs might work with side effects, or one drug, or none.\n\nIt would be natural to hope that these infections are extraordinary cases, but in fact, in the United States and Europe, 50 thousand people a year die of infections which no drugs can help. A project chartered by the British government known as the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance estimates that the worldwide toll right now is 700 thousand deaths a year. Also, if we can't get this under control by 2050, the worldwide toll will be 10 million deaths a year (more than the current population of New York City).\n\nThe scale of antibiotic resistance seems overwhelming, but if you've ever bought a fluorescent light bulb because you were concerned about climate change, you already know what it feels like to take a tiny step to address an overwhelming problem. We could take those kinds of steps for antibiotic use too. We could forgo giving an antibiotic for our kids’ ear infection, if we're not sure it's the right one. And we could promise each other to never again to buy chicken or shrimp or fruit raised with routine antibiotic use. If we did those things, we could slow down the arrival of the post-antibiotic world.\n""]",2,40-2,1596705,chain,1,254675
