           <p>You are being invited to take part in a research study. Before you decide to participate in this study, it is important that you understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take the time to read the following information carefully. Please ask the researcher if there is anything that is not clear or if you need more information.</p>

            <p><h3>Purpose of this research:</h3></p>

            <p>This project aims to collect data that can be used to evaluate formal accounts of causal learning, categorization, and language learning and to track how knowledge about these areas is transformed when passed from person to person.</p>

            <p><h3>Study procedures:</h3></p>

            <p>You will be presented with some information (e.g., a written narrative, hypothetical scenarios, or scientific data) and will then be asked to make one or more judgments about that information, or decisions based upon it. In some cases you will be asked to provide explanations or justifications for your responses, typically in the form of a short paragraph. The task will not involve deception or emotionally disturbing materials - just simple questions about categories, causal relationships, and languages. 
                The task you will perform will be one or more of the following: 1. Being shown a set of members of a category, and then asked to indicate which other objects are likely to belong to the category. 2. Being presented a sequence of pictures or sounds, and being asked to predict the next item in the sequence. 3. Being told a set of words in a language, and then making judgments about whether other words belong to the language. 4. Being shown statistical information about the interaction of causes and effects, and then making judgments about the causal relationships involved. 5. Observing a set of events or reading a description, and then evaluating the probability of other events or statements. 6. Being shown a list of words, and then being asked to recall the words.
            </p>
            
            <p>In some cases, you may be asked to provide audio through speaking. Your speech will be digitally transcribed in realtime. The audio will not be saved and will never be heard by other humans. Only the text which is transcribed may be passed on to future participants.</p>

            <p>The answers you provide in the task may be used as stimuli for future participants. However, data that would identify you will not be shared with other participants.</p>

            <p>Your total expected time commitment for this study is <b>10 minutes</b></p>

            <p><h3>Benefits and Risks:</h3></p>
            <p>There are no direct benefits to you as a participant; however, by furthering our understanding of human cognition, this research will benefit society by helping understand explore the evolutionary causes and consequences of human behavior.</p>

            <p>Risks associated with participation in this study are minimal. You may feel slight discomfort answering some questions, but you may refrain from answering any questions that make you uncomfortable and may withdraw your participation at any time even after completing the experiment without penalty.</p>

            <p><h3>Confidentiality:</h3></p>

            <p>We will not be asking for any personally identifying information, and we will handle responses as confidentially as possible. Your name, or your Worker IDs will never be tied to your responses on this survey. Data containing anything that might be personally identifiable (e.g. Worker IDs) will be encrypted on transfer and storage. We will be keeping data collected as part of this experiment indefinitely. This anonymized data (containing neither Worker IDs nor IP addresses) may be shared with the scientific community.</p>

            <p>Complete confidentiality of responses cannot be guaranteed because officials of the U. S. Army Human Research Protections Office are permitted by law to inspect the records obtained in this study to insure compliance with laws and regulations covering experiments using human subjects. Your data will not be associated with your name directly in any way. However, while the study is running it will be associated with your website ID which someone could potentially use to personally identify you. Once the study is complete, we will replace your website ID with a random string. These records may be shared with other researchers, but will not contain your website ID or any other personal information. Responses you make within the study may be shown to other participants, but these responses will not be linked to your personally identifiable information in any way.</p>

            <p><h3>Compensation:</h3></p>

            <p>For your participation, you will receive a base payment of $2.25, with an additional bonus that depends on the stimuli you observe and the quality of your answers. If you are on Mturk and for any reason you do not complete the study (e.g. technical difficulties, or a desire to stop), we will only be able to pay you if you send an email through MTurk, or by emailing the researcher at cocosci-lab@princeton.edu. If you have any questions about the study, feel free to contact the researcher or the Principal Investigator, Thomas Griffiths, at tomg@princeton.edu.   </p>
